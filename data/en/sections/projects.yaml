# your projects
projects:
- name: Legal Text Summarizer and Information Extraction Systems
  role: Developer
  timeline: "December 2019 - March 2020"
  #repo: https://github.com/ritusinha128/UNISYS-Student-innovation # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  url: "https://github.com/ritusinha128/UNISYS-Student-innovation"  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: Developed a system that is able to generate summaries and extract information from legal documents. This information can be queried using a chatbot. A specialized plugin was developed specifically for terms of service documents which used a Transformer model to recognize sentence polarity.
