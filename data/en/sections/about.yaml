# a summary about you
summary: 'As an avid lover of logic puzzles and the creative thinking that goes into them , I did not realize that this is what computer scientists do every day. Once I did, I was hooked, which led to the selection of my profession. I enjoy pratice more than theory and believe it to be the best method of learning.'
